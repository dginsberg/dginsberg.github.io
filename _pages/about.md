I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Mathematics
at Princeton University. I work
on problems in fluid dynamics and general relativity.
I am a member of the [Simons collaboration on hidden symmetries and fusion energy](https://hiddensymmetries.princeton.edu/).

You can find my [current CV here](assets/pdf/cv.pdf),
and a list of [publications here](/~dg42/publications).

I am an organizer of the [Analysis of Fluids and Related Topics Seminar](https://www.math.princeton.edu/events/seminars/analysis-fluids-and-related-topics).
