I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics
at Brooklyn College. I work
on problems in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and general relativity.
I am a member of the [Simons collaboration on hidden symmetries and fusion energy](https://hiddensymmetries.princeton.edu/).

You can find my [current CV here](assets/pdf/cv.pdf),
and a list of [publications here](/~dg42/publications).

I am an organizer of the [CUNY GC Harmonic Analysis & PDE Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/cuny-hapde/home), and the [Brooklyn College Colloquium](https://).
