description: From Instability to Singularity Formation in Incompressible Fluids
abstract: I will discuss a recent result obtained with F. Pasqualotto on finite-time singularity formation in incompressible fluids in C^{1,alpha}. The mechanism for singularity formation is related to the classical Rayleigh-Benard instability.
